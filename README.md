# DefiReturn UI

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn install`\
To install all required packages for the UI

`yarn start:local`\
Runs the UI connected to a local backend, for development and debugging\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

`yarn start`\
Runs the UI connected to our hosted backend (currently on Heroku). This makes it easier to get started because you don't have to install the backend, but it's harder to debug.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Heroku deployment
